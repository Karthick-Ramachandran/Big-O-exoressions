Big O Expressions


<h1> O(n) </h1>
<p> <b>as the n grows the runtime also grows </b> </p>




<h1>O(1) </h1>
<p> <b> whatever may be the value of n.. the runtime stays constant </b> </p>





<h1> Logarithms </h1>

efficient than O(n) and (O n square)

Logaritms are inverse to exponentiations



for example log base 2 (4) = 3 => 2 power 2 = 4


log base of value = exponent => 2 power exponent = value;

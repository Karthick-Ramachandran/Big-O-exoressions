Big O Expressions


O(n)
as the n grows the runtime also grows




O(1)

whatever may be the value of n.. the runtime stays constant




Logarithms

efficient than O(n square)

Logaritms are inverse to exponentiations



for example log base 2 (4) = 3 => 2 power 2 = 4


log base of value = exponent => 2 power exponent = value;
